This repo aims to provide a method of categorising our books using BERTopic (for shits and giggles if nothing else). 

Data is provided as a csv file containing the book titles, categories set using the Bookshelf app, and a description/blurb.

The code is a short python script using BERTopic and NLTK. The BERTopic code is taken almost verbatim from https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/quickstart/quickstart.html
